## Overview

**PWM** is a project written primarily in C, with small portions in Assembly and CMake.  
This repository implements functionality related to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), a common technique used in embedded systems, motor controls, and signal generation.

## Features

- High-performance PWM signal generation in C
- Low-level hardware interaction (Assembly)
- Easy build and configuration with CMake

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- CMake (for build configuration)
- [Optional] Assembler (if building/using assembly modules)

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harveker/PWM.git
cd PWM
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Usage
